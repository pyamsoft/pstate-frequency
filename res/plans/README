# NOTE
#
# Plans are currently directly sourced from the shell, meaning any and all
# shell script is valid in these files.
#
# pstate-frequency expects there to only be variable declarations in a plan file,
# but nothing is stopping pstate-frequency from sourcing a plan file which contains
# code and then executing said code. Make sure that none of your custom created
# plan file contain actual code in them or it will be executed.
#
# Because of the ability to execute arbitrary code, pstate-frequency only respects
# one location by default, which is handled by the root user on normal systems

# Plans should define the following
#
# EITHER
#
#   PLAN_AUTO_BAT [ plan name }
#     The identifier of the plan to run on battery
#
#   PLAN_AUTO_AC [ plan name }
#     The identifier of the plan to run on ac charger
#
# OR
#
#  PLAN_CPU_MAX [ number ]
#  PLAN_CPU_MIN [ number ]
#  PLAN_CPU_TURBO [ "on" | "off" ]
#  PLAN_CPU_PSTATE_GOVERNOR [ governor name ]
#  PLAN_CPU_CPUFREQ_GOVERNOR [ governor name ]
#  PLAN_CPU_EPP [ epp name ]
#
# If both are defined, the variables under PLAN_CPU take preference
